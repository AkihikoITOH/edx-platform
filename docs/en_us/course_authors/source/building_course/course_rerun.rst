Re-run a Course
###################

Another way to create a course in Studio is to re-run an existing course. When
you select the course re-run option, most, but not all, of the original course
content is duplicated to the new course. The original course is not changed in
any way.

.. _Create a Course Using Rerun:

********************************************
Use Re-Run to Create a Course
********************************************

To re-run a course, you must have permission to create courses in Studio. You
must also be a member of the course staff for the course that you want to re-
run.

To re-run a course:

#. Log in to Studio. Your dashboard lists the courses that you have access to
   as a staff memeber.

#. Move your cursor over each row in the list of courses. The **Re-Run Course**
   and **View Live** options appear for each course.

#. Locate the course you want to re-run and click **Re-Run Course**.

.. this image ^ is from the wireframe and needs to be replaced     

4. Supply a **Course Run** timeframe for the new course. The course number, the
   organization, and the course run are used to create the URL for the new
   course. The combination of these three values must be unique for the new
   course.

.. any of the 4 values can be changed, but we are not currently supporting
.. cross-organization use such as licensing

5. Click **Create Re-Run**. The duplication process takes several minutes. You
   can work in other parts of Studio or in the LMS, or on other web sites,
   while the process runs.

  When the configuration of the new course is complete, it is listed on your
  **My Courses** dashboard in Studio.

.. _Update the New Course:

********************************************
Update the New Course
********************************************

When you create a course by re-running another course, careful review of course
settings and content is needed. At a minimum, you make these changes to prepare
the new course for release:

* Add course staff members. See :ref:`Add Course Team Members` or
  :ref:`Course_Staffing`.
  
* Update course-wide dates, including course and enrollment start and end
  dates. See :ref:`Set Important Dates for Your Course`.

* Change the release dates of course sections, subsections, and units. See
  :ref:`Release Dates`.

* Delete or edit posts on the **Course Updates** page in Studio. See :ref:`Add
  a Course Update`.

* Review the staff biographies and other information on the course summary
  page and make needed updates. See :ref:`The Course Summary Page`.

* Add initial wiki articles.

* Create initial posts for the discussion topics and an "introduce yourself"
  post. See :ref:`Discussions`.
  
You can use the :ref:`course checklists<Use the Course Checklist>` to work
through the course and verify that it is ready for release.

The courses that you create with the re-run option should be tested thoroughly
before the release date to assure the same quality student experience. See
:ref:`Testing Your Course` and :ref:`Beta_Testing`.

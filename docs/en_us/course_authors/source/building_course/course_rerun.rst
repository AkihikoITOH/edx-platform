Re-run a Course
###################

Another way to create a course in Studio is to re-run an existing course. When
you select the course re-run option, most, but not all, of the original course
content is duplicated to the new course. The original course is not changed in
any way.

.. _Use ReRun to Create a Course:

********************************************
Use Re-Run to Create a Course
********************************************

Before you re-run a course:

* For a course that is on the `edge.edx.org`_ site, verify that you have
  permission to create courses in Studio. See :ref:`Use Studio on Edge`.

  For a course that is on the `edx.org`_ site, contact your Program Manager.
  Your Program Manager actually creates the new course using the re-run
  feature, and then works with you to complete the steps to :ref:`update the
  new course<Update the New Course>`.

* Verify that you are a member of the course staff for the course that you want
  to re-run.

* Verify that the original course was created in Studio, not in XML.

To re-run a course:

#. Log in to Studio. Your dashboard lists the courses that you have access to
   as a staff memeber.

#. Move your cursor over each row in the list of courses. The **Re-Run Course**
   and **View Live** options appear for each course.

#. Locate the course you want to re-run and click **Re-Run Course**.

.. this image ^ is from the wireframe and needs to be replaced     

4. Supply a **Course Run** timeframe for the new course. The course number, the
   organization, and the course run are used to create the URL for the new
   course. The combination of these three values must be unique for the new
   course.

.. any of the 4 values can be changed, but we are not currently supporting
.. cross-organization use such as licensing

5. Click **Create Re-Run**. The duplication process takes several minutes. You
   can work in other parts of Studio or in the LMS, or on other web sites,
   while the process runs.

  The new course appears on your **My Courses** dashboard in Studio when
  configuration is complete.

.. _Update the New Course:

********************************************
Update the New Course
********************************************

When you create a course by re-running another course, you should carefully
review the course settings and content. At a minimum, you will need to make
these changes to prepare the new course for release:

* Add course staff members. See :ref:`Add Course Team Members` or
  :ref:`Course_Staffing`.
  
* Update course-wide dates, including course and enrollment start and end
  dates. See :ref:`Set Important Dates for Your Course`.

* Change the release dates of course sections, subsections, and units. See
  :ref:`Release Dates`.

* Change the due dates of subsections that are part of your grading policy. See
  :ref:`subsections`.

* Delete or edit posts on the **Course Updates** page in Studio. See :ref:`Add
  a Course Update`.

* Review the staff biographies and other information on the course summary
  page and make needed updates. See :ref:`The Course Summary Page`.

* Add initial wiki articles.

* Create initial posts for discussion topics and an "introduce yourself"
  post. See :ref:`Discussions`.
  
You can use the :ref:`course checklists<Use the Course Checklist>` to work
through the course and verify that it is ready for release.

To assure a quality experience for course students, be sure to test a course
created with the re-run option thoroughly before the course start date.
See :ref:`Testing Your Course` and :ref:`Beta_Testing`.
